# Fibonacci
Generate items in the fibonacci sequence
### To run (C)
```
make
./main (term number here)
```
### To run (python 3)
`./main.py (term number here)`
### Additional notes
This C program can calculate up to the 93th item in the fibonacci sequence accurately on a 64-bit system.
# TODO
* Optimize main.c and main.py to only use the previous two items in the fibonacci sequence.
